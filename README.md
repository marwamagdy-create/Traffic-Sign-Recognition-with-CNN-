## ðŸ“„ Project Overview
This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify traffic signs from the **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)** dataset. The model recognizes **43 different traffic sign classes**, essential for autonomous driving and driver assistance systems.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - Images resized to **32Ã—32 pixels** and normalized (0â€“1 scale).  
  - Labels one-hot encoded for multi-class classification.  

- **CNN Architecture:**  
  - Three convolutional layers (filters: 32, 64, 128) with **ReLU activation**.  
  - **MaxPooling** after each convolutional layer.  
  - **Dropout layers** (0.5 after conv layers, 0.6 in dense layer) to reduce overfitting.  
  - Fully connected layers with **128 units** and **softmax output** for 43 classes.  

- **Training:**  
  - **30 epochs** using **Adam optimizer** and **categorical cross-entropy loss**.  

- **Performance:**  
  - Achieves over **98% validation accuracy**, showing strong generalization.  

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset
- **Total images:** 51,839 (32Ã—32Ã—3)  
- **Split:**  
  - Training: 34,799  
  - Validation: 4,410  
  - Testing: 12,630  
- **Classes:** 43 (speed limits, warning, directional, and prohibitory signs).  

## ðŸ“Š Results
